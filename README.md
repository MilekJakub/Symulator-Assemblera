## About project
Assembler Simulator is project for need to pass subject of Computer Systems Architecture.

The project is based on the creation of an application with a UI that will allow for a simple visual simulation of commands issued to the processor in the Assembler language.
The processor for which we simulate the commands is Intel 8086.
It is a 16-bit processor introduced on June 8, 1978.

## About simulator
The simulator has a visualization of two simple commands:
- The MOV (Move) command allows you to transfer hexadecimal numbers to arithmetic registers using immediate addressing.
- The XCHG (Exchange) command allows you to convert the values of two arithmetic registers.

<p>The simulator in its interface allows you to enter numbers in the text fields AX, BX, CX, DX.</p>
<p>To confirm the entry to the registers, click the MOV button.</p>
<p>To simulate the XCHG command, select in the panels, from which register the value should be replaced with the value of the second register, and then confirm the operation with the XCHG button.</p>
